.SYNOPSIS
    Builds the Partner Center attestation-signing submission for the Nimbus
    Mouse Filter, and verifies the package that comes back.

.DESCRIPTION
    Attestation signing takes a CAB file, signed with the EV certificate that
    is registered on the Hardware Developer Program account, and returns the
    same driver signed by Microsoft. This script produces that CAB:

      1. (optional) builds Release x64 with build.ps1
      2. stages inf + sys + pdb into out\submission\nimbus_moufilter\
      3. (optional) re-stamps DriverVer with an explicit version
      4. regenerates the catalog with Inf2Cat so it matches the staged INF
      5. re-signs the .sys and .cat with the EV certificate, replacing the
         WDKTestCert signatures the build applies
      6. packs the folder into a CAB with makecab
      7. signs the CAB (SHA-256 only, RFC-3161 timestamp) and verifies it

    The rules the submission has to satisfy, and the reason each step is here,
    are in driver\SIGNING.md. The two that bite silently: the CAB must be
    SHA-256 signed only (never dual-signed with SHA-1, unlike the app
    installer in build_tools\sign_exe.bat), and every file must sit in a
    subfolder of the CAB, never at its root.

    Run -VerifySigned against the package downloaded from Partner Center to
    confirm Microsoft signed it before it goes anywhere near a user.

.PARAMETER Build
    Run build.ps1 first instead of packaging whatever is already built.

.PARAMETER DriverVersion
    Four-part version to stamp into DriverVer (for example 1.0.0.4). Omitted,
    the build's own stamp is kept, which is the build date and time. A release
    should pass an explicit version: Windows picks the driver with the higher
    DriverVer when a package is replaced.

.PARAMETER Thumbprint
    SHA-1 thumbprint of the EV certificate. Preferred over -CertSubject: the
    machine also holds a WDKTestCert, and picking the wrong one produces a CAB
    that Partner Center rejects.

.PARAMETER CertSubject
    Substring of the EV certificate subject, passed to signtool /n.

.PARAMETER SkipSign
    Build the CAB without signing it. For inspecting the layout without the
    hardware token plugged in. The result contains test-signed binaries and
    must not be submitted.

.PARAMETER VerifySigned
    Path to the driver folder (or a .sys/.cat inside it) returned by Partner
    Center. Checks the signature chains up to the Microsoft Windows Hardware
    Compatibility Publisher, and reports the signer of every file. Does not
    build anything.
