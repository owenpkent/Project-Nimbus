.SYNOPSIS
    Read-only health check for the Nimbus Mouse Filter dev install. Answers
    one question: would the mouse survive the next reboot?

.DESCRIPTION
    A class upper filter is mandatory once listed. install-dev.ps1 verifies
    that at install time and rolls back if the driver does not load, but
    nothing stops the machine from drifting out from under a filter that
    installed cleanly. Anything that stops Code Integrity accepting the
    test-signed .sys leaves the filter registered and unloadable, and the
    mouse does not start at the next boot:

      * a Windows update that resets boot configuration
      * "bcdedit /set testsigning off" (what you do to play an anti-cheat game)
      * Secure Boot switched back on in firmware
      * a rebuild signed with a certificate no longer in the machine stores

    Run this before rebooting, before turning test signing off, and after
    Windows updates. It needs no elevation and changes nothing.

    Exit codes:
      0  safe (filter not installed, or installed and loadable)
      1  ARMED AND UNLOADABLE: the filter is registered but would not load.
         The mouse dies at the next mouse restart or reboot. Fix it now.
      2  the mouse is already broken by the filter.
