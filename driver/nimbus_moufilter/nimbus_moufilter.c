/*
 * nimbus_moufilter.c
 *
 * Nimbus Mouse Filter: a KMDF upper filter on the mouse class that can hand
 * the physical mouse to Nimbus Adaptive Controller.
 *
 * Derived from Microsoft's moufiltr sample (input/moufiltr in the
 * Windows-driver-samples repository, MIT). The i8042 ISR hook of the sample
 * is removed; only the MOUSE_INPUT_DATA report chain is filtered.
 *
 * Behaviour
 * ---------
 * Pass-through by default: every packet reaches mouclass unchanged.
 *
 * While a client holds \\.\NimbusMouseFilter open and has sent
 * IOCTL_NIMBUS_SET_ISOLATION(1), packets from every filtered mouse are kept
 * from mouclass and queued for the client, which reads them with ReadFile.
 * The Windows cursor, Raw Input, and every application therefore stop seeing
 * the physical mouse; the client is the only consumer.
 *
 * Release guarantees
 * ------------------
 * - The control device is exclusive: one client at a time.
 * - Handle cleanup (crash, kill, exit) restores pass-through.
 * - A watchdog restores pass-through if no read has arrived from the client
 *   for NIMBUS_MOUFILTER_WATCHDOG_MS while isolating. It runs only while
 *   isolating. A read that has been parked for NIMBUS_MOUFILTER_TICK_MS with
 *   nothing to deliver is completed empty first (a heartbeat tick), so a
 *   client that is frozen or suspended, and therefore never issues the next
 *   read, loses the mouse too (interface v3). Reads already parked do not
 *   postpone the deadline: it turns on the idle time alone (interface v5),
 *   so the bound holds however many reads the client left in the queue.
 * - Reads fail with STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_READY whenever isolation is off, so a
 *   client whose read comes back that way knows the mouse was given back
 *   instead of waiting forever for packets that will never be captured.
 *   Every release path clears the flag under the lock and then drains the
 *   read queue, EvtIoRead re-checks the flag after parking a read, and
 *   NimbusCompleteRead re-checks it under the lock before completing, so a
 *   read can neither be left parked across a release nor complete as though
 *   it had been serviced by one.
 * - The keyboard is never touched.
 *
 * Environment: kernel mode only.
