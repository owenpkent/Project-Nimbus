/*
 * nimbus_moufilter_ioctl.h
 *
 * Public interface of the Nimbus Mouse Filter, shared between the kernel
 * driver and user mode (src/mouse_isolation_win.py mirrors these values).
 *
 * The driver is an upper filter on the mouse class. With no client attached it
 * passes every packet through unchanged. While a client holds the control
 * device open and has enabled isolation, packets from every physical mouse
 * are withheld from mouclass (so neither the cursor, Raw Input, nor any game
 * sees them) and are delivered to the client through ReadFile instead.
 *
 * Reads return an array of MOUSE_INPUT_DATA (ntddmou.h, 24 bytes each):
 *   USHORT UnitId; USHORT Flags; USHORT ButtonFlags; USHORT ButtonData;
 *   ULONG RawButtons; LONG LastX; LONG LastY; ULONG ExtraInformation;
 * A read completes as soon as at least one packet is available. A read that
 * has been parked for NIMBUS_MOUFILTER_TICK_MS with nothing to deliver is
 * completed with zero bytes (a tick); the client simply issues a new read.
 * That is the heartbeat: only a read's arrival, or its completion with
 * packets, counts as client activity, so a client that is frozen or suspended
 * stops re-issuing and the watchdog gives the mouse back within
 * NIMBUS_MOUFILTER_WATCHDOG_MS of its last read. A read that is issued, or
 * still pending, while isolation is off fails with STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_READY
 * (ERROR_NOT_READY, 21, in user mode). That is how a client learns that the
 * watchdog released the mouse; a client that turned isolation off itself sees
 * the same failure on its parked read.
 *
 * Safety: isolation is cleared when the client's handle is cleaned up (crash,
 * kill, exit) and by a watchdog when no read has *arrived* for
 * NIMBUS_MOUFILTER_WATCHDOG_MS while isolating. Reads already parked in the
 * queue do not postpone that deadline (v5); they are failed by the release.
 *
 * The stall a live client survives is NIMBUS_MOUFILTER_WATCHDOG_MS minus the
 * age of its parked read, and that read is re-issued after each tick, so the
 * tick length sets the floor: with a 250 ms tick (one watchdog period) the
 * read is at most about 500 ms old and a client can stall for 1.5 s. That
 * bound no longer depends on how many reads the client has parked.
 *
 * Interface versions
 *   1  first build: SET_ISOLATION, GET_STATUS, ReadFile delivery
 *   2  reads fail with STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_READY while isolation is off
 *   3  parked reads are completed empty after NIMBUS_MOUFILTER_TICK_MS (heartbeat)
 *   4  tick shortened from 1000 to 250 ms (stall tolerance floor 0.75 s -> 1.5 s)
 *   5  the watchdog releases on idle time alone, so parked reads no longer
 *      extend the deadline (a frozen client that had parked N reads used to
 *      hold the mouse for about N * NIMBUS_MOUFILTER_TICK_MS); and a read
 *      pulled off the queue just before a release now fails with
 *      STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_READY instead of completing empty like a tick
