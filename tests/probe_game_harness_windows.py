"""
Game harness runner (throwaway, not Nimbus code).

Launches a real game from a recipe in ``tests/games/``, owns the pad it
reads, and measures what stick and button input do to it, in the game's own
units where the recipe has a console oracle. ``docs/vision/GAME_TEST_HARNESS.md``
is the plan and the results log; ``tests/game_harness.py`` is the machinery.

Actuators
---------
pad (default)
    A ViGEm pad of the harness's own. Calibrates the game:

    G0  launch: the game window appears within the recipe's timeout, and the
        recipe's ``window`` (size, position, borderless) is applied and re-applied
        as the game loads, recording whether it took
    G1  ready: the oracle answers (a pose is read: from the console log on
        Source, from the clipboard on Arma 3)
    G2  reset: the player is put back within 2 units and 1 degree; with no
        console but ``reset_buttons`` in the recipe, a second of left stick
        then the buttons brings the picture back to a reference frame
    G3  idle: several seconds of nothing leave the pose alone; the noise
        floor and the motion thresholds come from all of them
    G4  yaw control: right stick full right turns more than 10 degrees, the recipe's way
    G5  yaw sweep: degrees per second at each magnitude; the game's deadzone;
        the frame verdict beside the ground truth for each step, from the
        measured motion (tests/frame_motion.py) rather than a changed count
    G6  yaw left: opposite sign, rate within 25 percent of the right turn
    G7  pitch: right stick up changes the pitch by more than 1 degree
    G8  move: left stick up for a second moves the player more than the recipe's
        walk_min_units (20 by default; metres on Arma 3)
    G9  button: the pad button bound to an echo marker reaches the oracle
    G10 release: nothing is stuck afterwards
    G11 latency: the first pose sample whose yaw moved after the stick went on
    G12 calibration: yaw against hold time at several magnitudes, and walk
        against hold time; ``--write-calibration`` writes the table into
        ``src/spectator/calibrations/<game>.json`` for the primitives
nimbus
    The real Nimbus app in-process, driving the same environment through its
    widgets, on a throwaway copy of the bundled profile (``--profile <id>``
    runs an existing one instead); what the bridge sent is recorded beside
    what the game did, and the expected values come from the bridge's own
    resolved parameters, never from a number in the docs:

    N0  app: window, ViGEm mode, an rx/ry stick found, game launched second and ready
    N1  full drag: turns more than 10 degrees, the bridge sent its ceiling (0.95 bundled)
    N2  one-pixel drag: turns more than 1 degree (the anti-deadzone floor, in degrees)
    N3  release: the bridge reads zero and the pose is stable
    N4  button: a click on the bumper widget produces the echo marker
    N5  left stick: a full drag up moves the player more than 20 units, ceiling sent

    then the Spectator+ v0 primitives through the bridge's runner, planned
    from the calibration G12 wrote and measured by the game:

    P0  the bridge's runner loads this game's calibration
    P1  turn right 90 degrees, P2 turn left 45, P3 turn right 10: within
        15 percent or 5 degrees
    P4  walk 100 units: within 20 percent or 10 units
    P5  stop: a long walk cut short releases the stick and the player stops

Run (from the repo root, venv with PySide6; ViGEmBus installed;
Steam able to sign in without a prompt)::

    venv\\Scripts\\python tests\\probe_game_harness_windows.py --game left4dead2 --actuator pad
    venv\\Scripts\\python tests\\probe_game_harness_windows.py --game left4dead2 --actuator nimbus

Run them one at a time: each session's pad has to be player one, and the
runner quits the game at the end unless ``--keep-game`` is given. A recipe
whose ``reset_pose`` is null takes the first pose read as the session's reset
pose and prints it; ``--write-reset-pose`` writes it into the recipe.

Expected values. A recipe's ``expect`` block bands what a check measured
last time (degrees, units or pixels per second, with a tolerance), and the
runner records a ``<check>e`` line for each band, so a run fails when the
game's answer changed and not only when it stopped answering.
``--write-expect`` fills the block from a good run for the checks in
``--expect-checks`` (G5 at ``--expect-mags``, G7, G8, N2, N5 by default),
merging with what is there, so the pad run and the Nimbus run each keep
their own.
