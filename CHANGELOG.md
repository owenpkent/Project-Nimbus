## [Unreleased]

### Documentation
- **Driver release signing** (`driver/SIGNING.md`): The route from the test-signed dev build to one that loads on retail Windows with Secure Boot on and anti-cheat running. Hardware Developer Program prerequisites (Entra global administrator, company details, a legal contact who answers Microsoft's questionnaire, the EV certificate we already hold), the submission rules that fail silently otherwise (subfolders only, SHA-256 only, no UNC, `.pdb` required), Partner Center steps, verification of the returned package, and the re-validation that follows. Records where attestation stands after the April 2026 Windows Driver Policy: that policy removes trust for **cross-signed** drivers, not attestation-signed ones, but Microsoft's own page now files attestation under "for testing scenarios", so the signed build is good for this release cycle and not settled infrastructure. `docs/vision/WINDOWS_MOUSE_FILTER_PLAN.md` sections 3 and 6 updated to match.
- **Installer driver bootstrap** (`docs/setup/PACKAGING.md`, `docs/setup/INSTALLATION.md`): Documents the bundled drivers, the `fetch_redist.ps1` build step, each setup's silent flags, the reboot and failure paths, and the clean-VM checks to run before a release. The prerequisites section no longer tells users to install vJoy and ViGEmBus themselves.
- **Windows Raw Input measurements** (`docs/vision/HOST_MODE_ISOLATION.md`, sections 8 and 9): Measured on Windows 11 25H2 that a `WH_MOUSE_LL` hook dropping every mouse event leaves `WM_INPUT` untouched, that only a foreground change stops it, and that Elden Ring (EAC) then ignores the gamepad, so user mode cannot close the Raw Input gap. Carrier Command 2 measured as a cursor-path game that the existing hook already covers. Section 9 records the checked state of Interception, OpenInputBridge, UsbDk, HidHide, RawAccel, and the 2026 Windows Driver Policy, with sources. `docs/GAME_COMPATIBILITY.md` updated to match.
- **Windows Mouse Filter Plan** (`docs/vision/WINDOWS_MOUSE_FILTER_PLAN.md`): Design for a `moufiltr`-based mouclass upper filter that hands the physical mouse to Nimbus, with the same user-mode class API as the Linux `mouse_isolation` module, safety guarantees, signing, test plan, and order of work.
- **Industry-standard docstrings** — Added Google-style module and class docstrings to `src/bridge.py`, `src/qt_main.py`, `src/qt_qml_app.py`, `src/qt_widgets.py`, and `src/qt_dialogs.py`. The bridge now documents its full signal inventory and threading model; Qt widget classes document their normalized output ranges and signal contracts; the QML entry point lists all context properties exposed to QML. The remaining ten modules in `src/` already carried full Google/NumPy-style docstrings and were left unchanged.
- **Cephable integration analysis** (`docs/vision/CEPHABLE_INTEGRATION.md`): Analysis of the Cephable virtual-controller sample, covering its SignalR hub protocol, OAuth and device-registration flow, event schema (`KeyPress`/`KeyRelease`/`KeyToggle`, `JoystickMove` on a -100..100 axis range, `Pause`), and a proposed path to consume Cephable commands through the existing Nimbus output layer.

### Fixed
- **The installer now actually installs the controller drivers** (`build_tools/installer.nsi`, `build_tools/fetch_redist.ps1`): The vJoy and ViGEmBus downloads had never worked in any release. Both release URLs 404 (the assets are `vJoySetup-2.2.1-signed.exe` and `ViGEmBus_1.22.0_x64_x86_arm64.exe`, not the names in the script), and `NSISdl::download`, the only download plugin present, speaks plain HTTP and cannot fetch an `https://` URL at all, so every user who ticked a driver got a failure dialog and no driver. Both setups are now bundled in the installer, so an offline machine, a proxy, or a moved release asset cannot break it, at a cost of about 13 MB compressed. `fetch_redist.ps1` pulls them at build time and refuses anything whose SHA-256 or publisher signature does not match. The installer runs vJoy with `/VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART` (Inno Setup) and ViGEmBus with `/exenoui /qn /norestart` (Advanced Installer bootstrapper), then re-detects each driver rather than trusting the exit code; 3010 and 1641 are treated as "installed, restart needed" and raise the NSIS reboot flag so the finish page offers the restart. A genuine failure copies the setup to `$INSTDIR\drivers\` and offers to run it with its own window, and one summary dialog at the end names anything still missing. The uninstaller cleans that folder and deliberately leaves vJoy and ViGEmBus installed, since other mappers share them.
- **The bundled vJoy is 2.1.9.1, not 2.2.1** (`build_tools/fetch_redist.ps1`, `build_tools/installer.nsi`): The first live runs of the installer probe showed the njz3 2.2.1 driver failing to load on Windows 11 25H2 on a clean boot (`vjoy.sys` returns `0xC000009A` from `WdfCollectionCreate`, njz3/vJoy issue 17, open since December 2023; no Memory Integrity, no Code Integrity block), after which `vJoyInstall.exe` removes its own device and leaves an install that reports 0 buttons. Justin Shafer's 2019 build of the original 2.1.9.1 works (128 buttons, 8 axes, status FREE, measured the same day) and its `vJoy.sys` and catalog are signed by the Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility Publisher, so it also survives the April 2026 driver policy. BrunnerInnovation's signed 2.2.2.0 is reported failing the same way as of April 2026 and was not bundled.
- **vJoy device 1 is configured again** (`build_tools/installer.nsi`): The post-install `vJoyConfig` call used `$PROGRAMFILES`, which in the 32-bit installer resolves to Program Files (x86), where vJoy never installs, so the 8 axes and 128 buttons Nimbus profiles expect were never applied. It now prefers `$PROGRAMFILES64` and falls back, and reports what happened either way.

### Added
- **Installer driver probe** (`tests/probe_installer_drivers_windows.ps1`): Eleven numbered checks over the installer's driver bootstrap, unattended after the elevation prompt. Two runs with a reboot between them: `-Teardown` removes vJoy and ViGEmBus and records the boot time, and the install run refuses to continue in the same boot, because a removed kernel driver is still resident and a reinstall on top of it fails in ways that look like installer bugs (measured: vJoy's device failed to start with `STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES` and `vJoyInstall.exe` rolled it back). The install run drives `/S`, then verifies against the machine rather than the exit code: both drivers back with devices attached, vJoy device 1 reporting 8 axes and 128 buttons through `vJoyInterface.dll`, a ViGEm pad opened from vgamepad, no leftover `drivers\` folder (which only appears when an install failed), the app starting and showing a window, and finally the app uninstalling while both drivers survive. Both logs land in `dist\` whatever happens.
- **Driver detection requires a device** (`build_tools/installer.nsi`): Files, uninstall keys and service entries all survive a driver removal or a failed device start, so `DetectVJoy` and `DetectViGEm` now also require a device attached to the driver (`Enum\Count` under the service key). A ViGEmBus removed minutes earlier still answered `sc query` with 0 while vgamepad failed with `VIGEM_ERROR_BUS_NOT_FOUND`, and the page would have called it "Already installed". Both states now get a **Repair** checkbox, and the reinstall recreates the device.
- **Silent install handles drivers** (`build_tools/installer.nsi`): `Setup.exe /S` skips every custom page, so nothing set the driver choices and a scripted deployment got the app and no drivers. `.onInit` now defaults to installing whichever driver is missing, and all six `MessageBox` calls carry `/SD` defaults, without which a silent install stops on a dialog nobody can see. The driver-failure prompts default to not launching a GUI installer.
- **Bundled driver fetcher** (`build_tools/fetch_redist.ps1`): Downloads vJoy 2.1.9.1 and ViGEmBus 1.22.0 into the gitignored `build_tools/redist/`, pinned by SHA-256 and checked for a valid Authenticode signature from the expected publisher, deleting anything that fails. Cached copies are re-verified rather than trusted. Run it before `makensis`.
- **Driver submission packager** (`driver/package.ps1`): Builds the CAB for Partner Center attestation signing. Stages `inf` + `sys` + `pdb`, re-stamps `DriverVer` with an explicit version, regenerates the catalog with Inf2Cat so it matches the staged INF, re-signs the `.sys` and `.cat` with the EV certificate over the WDKTestCert signatures the build leaves, packs a `nimbus_moufilter\` subfolder with makecab, then signs the CAB SHA-256 only with an RFC-3161 timestamp and verifies it. Refuses `/a` certificate auto-selection (this machine also holds a WDKTestCert) and fails if the signer turns out to be the test certificate. `-SkipSign` builds the CAB without the hardware token for inspection; `-VerifySigned` checks that every file in the returned package is signed by the Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility Publisher. Dry run passes end to end, Inf2Cat clean; nothing submitted yet.
- **Mouse filter battle test** (`tests/probe_mouse_filter_stress_windows.py`): Unattended adversarial stress of the kernel filter (B1 to B13): IOCTL and read storms, a 512-read flood, open/close storms in threads and across six processes with a kill every 400 ms, thirty chaos kills during client start-up, stall-tolerance measurement, an inherited-handle leak, CPU starvation at NORMAL and HIGH priority, a fuzz of every file API the control device accepts (random control codes, invalid pointers, every IRP major, 36 open variants, a duplicate-handle storm), a synchronous-read matrix, a desktop-switch pause check and a soak, with the driver's own pool tag as the leak check. 15/15 on the dev machine, also under Driver Verifier. It found that a HIGH-priority CPU burn starved a normal-priority reader past the watchdog, so the client's reader thread now runs at `THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL`; WDK Code Analysis on the driver (two paging violations, one false positive) and CodeQL (`microsoft/windows-drivers`, clean) were run alongside and the fixes are in.
- **Interface v4: 250 ms heartbeat tick** (`driver/nimbus_moufilter/nimbus_moufilter_ioctl.h`, `src/mouse_isolation_win.py`): A live client survives a stall of the 2 s watchdog minus the age of its parked read, and that read is re-issued after each tick, so the 1 s tick of v3 left a floor of 0.75 s. The 250 ms tick raises it to 1.5 s at no cost (the reader already wakes every 100 ms for the hotkey). Contract change, so the client refuses a v3 driver.
- **Secure-desktop pause** (`src/mouse_isolation_win.py`): While the lock screen, a UAC prompt or Ctrl+Alt+Del has the input, the cursor relay cannot reach the cursor and the hotkey cannot be seen, so the client now turns isolation off for as long as another desktop has the input and turns it on again when its own desktop returns, keeping the device handle (`MouseIsolation.paused`). Measured with a private desktop: off within 40 ms, on again at once.
- **Nimbus Mouse Filter driver** (`driver/`): A KMDF upper filter on the mouse class, derived from Microsoft's `moufiltr` sample, that withholds physical mouse packets from `mouclass` while Nimbus holds `\\.\NimbusMouseFilter` open with isolation on and delivers them to Nimbus through `ReadFile`. Pass-through by default; isolation is cleared on handle cleanup and by a 2 s read watchdog that runs only while isolating, after which reads fail with `STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_READY` so the client notices (interface v2). Every release path drains parked reads under a single helper, the capture-or-pass decision is made under the driver's lock, and the read queue is protected by a rundown reference while the control device is torn down; the keyboard is never touched. Builds and test-signs with WDK 10.0.26100; loaded and validated on hardware on 2026-09-05 (attended probe 9/9: the fake Raw Input game received zero `WM_INPUT` while the driver captured every packet); not yet attestation-signed or validated against an anti-cheat game. Dev scripts for build, test signing, install (which also updates a loaded build) and uninstall included.
- **Windows mouse isolation client** (`src/mouse_isolation_win.py`): Same `MouseIsolation` class API as the Linux `mouse_isolation` module on the `linux-uinput-support` branch (evdev button codes included), so that branch's bridge integration can carry over once it merges; the bridge on this branch does not use the module yet. Reports a watchdog release through `on_stopped`, refuses to start when the driver is attached to no mouse, converts absolute-motion packets (RDP, VM pointers) to deltas, issues every control IOCTL with its own `OVERLAPPED`, answers status and device queries through the active instance's handle while isolating, and sets `MOUSE_ISOLATION_AVAILABLE` only when the driver's control device exists, so a Windows machine without the driver keeps the existing Game Mode path. `python -m src.mouse_isolation_win --status` reports the driver's counters.
- **Mouse filter probe** (`tests/probe_mouse_filter_windows.py`): Unattended lifecycle, handle-drop, watchdog, exclusivity and read-after-release checks (U1 to U6); ten unattended robustness checks (U7 to U16: client API edges, watchdog timing, read cycling, `TerminateProcess` and `NtSuspendProcess` of the client, start/stop and open-race stress, parked-read draining, 19 malformed-request cases, an idle soak; all passed on the dev machine on 2026-09-05, and again under Driver Verifier after a reboot), an injected `Ctrl+Alt+F12` check (U17); plus attended pass-through / isolated / released / relay phases against the fake Raw Input game.
- **Cursor relay and heartbeat** (`src/mouse_isolation_win.py`, `driver/`): `MouseIsolation(cursor_relay=True)` moves the real Windows cursor from the captured packets with `SetCursorPos`, which creates no input event (measured: zero `WM_INPUT`, zero `WH_MOUSE_LL` events at a foreground Raw Input window), so the mouse keeps working everywhere while the game keeps the foreground and sees no motion; `inject_button()` / `inject_wheel()` replay clicks with `SendInput` where the bridge wants them; `hotkey=True` now polls `Ctrl+Alt+F12` on the reader thread. Driver interface v3: a read parked for 1 s with nothing to deliver is completed empty and only a read's arrival keeps isolation alive, so a frozen or suspended Nimbus loses the mouse within 2 s (installed and probed 17/17 under Driver Verifier).
- **Raw Input probe** (`tests/probe_rawinput_windows.py`): `setcursorpos` scenario, the measurement behind the cursor relay.
- **Full Game Mode mouse isolation** (`src/bridge.py`): On Windows with the filter installed, Full Game Mode now also takes the physical mouse away from the game through the driver and the cursor relay (`MOUSE_ISOLATION_AVAILABLE`, `startMouseIsolation` / `stopMouseIsolation`, `mouseIsolationChanged`, same names as the Linux branch). The real cursor keeps working; it is never relayed over the game window unless that spot is Nimbus; clicks over Nimbus are synthesised into Qt so the game sees nothing, clicks elsewhere are replayed with `SendInput`; `Ctrl+Alt+F12` releases. Game Mode brings the game to the foreground itself, and a cursor found over the game is parked onto Nimbus. Custom-layout widgets carry `objectName: "widget_<id>"` so tests can find them.
- **Nimbus relay probe** (`tests/probe_nimbus_relay_windows.py`): Runs the real QML app in-process in Full Game Mode against the fake Raw Input game, with a stand-in for the driver that feeds packets through the module's parser (8/8 on the dev machine), or with the real driver and a hand on the mouse (`--attended`).
- **Windows input probes** (`tests/probe_rawinput_windows.py`, `tests/probe_game_mouselook_windows.py`): Throwaway diagnostics that register for Raw Input like a game and measure which countermeasures stop `WM_INPUT`, and that measure in-game camera motion under a mouse sweep, the `WH_MOUSE_LL` hook, a foreground change, and the ViGEm right stick. Windows counterparts of the Linux branch's probes; both gain a driver scenario once the mouse filter exists.
- **Cephable sample-data fixtures** (`tests/fixtures/cephable/`): Seven MIT-licensed JSON fixtures from Cephable's `src/sample-data/` (basic keys, simple and complex gamepad and keyboard-mouse macros, plus the key/button value namespace), with the upstream `README.md` kept for provenance. Replayable offline as a regression corpus for the input pipeline.
- **User Accounts** (`src/cloud_client.py`) — Optional sign-in with Email, Google OAuth, or Facebook OAuth via Supabase. Tokens stored securely in OS credential vault (Windows Credential Manager) via `keyring`. Supports session restore, silent token refresh, and offline fallback.
- **Cloud Profile Sync** — Nimbus+ subscribers can sync profiles across machines. Last-write-wins merge strategy per profile ID. Push on save, pull on startup.
- **Telemetry & Crash Reporting** (`src/telemetry.py`) — Opt-in anonymous usage analytics and crash reporting. Events buffered locally and batch-flushed every 5 minutes. No PII collected — all identifiers are SHA-256 hashed. Optional Sentry SDK integration for structured crash reports.
- **Auto-Updater** (`src/updater.py`) — Lightweight version checker that fetches a JSON manifest on startup. Non-intrusive ribbon notification when a new version is available. Supports stable/beta/dev update channels. Force-update warning when running below minimum supported version.
- **Account Dialog** (`qml/components/AccountDialog.qml`) — Sign-in UI with Google, Facebook, and email/password options. Shows account status, tier, and sync button when signed in.
- **Privacy Settings Dialog** (`qml/components/SettingsPrivacyDialog.qml`) — Toggle crash reports and analytics independently. Expandable "What we collect" and "What we NEVER collect" sections for full transparency.
- **Update Notification Ribbon** (`qml/components/UpdateNotification.qml`) — Non-intrusive top-of-window ribbon with download and dismiss buttons. Connects to `UpdateChecker` signals.
- **New dependencies**: `httpx>=0.27.0` (async HTTP), `keyring>=25.0.0` (OS credential vault), `sentry-sdk>=2.0.0` (crash reporting)
- **Documentation**: `docs/setup/ACCOUNTS.md`, `docs/setup/TELEMETRY.md`, `docs/setup/UPDATER.md` — comprehensive setup and usage guides for all three new systems.

## [1.4.3] — 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **Installer vJoy detection** — Added `SetRegView 64` before registry reads so NSIS checks the native 64-bit hive instead of WOW6432Node. Now correctly detects installed vJoy and disables the install checkbox.
- **Start Menu shortcut creation** — Removed icon argument from `CreateShortCut` to prevent silent failure when install path contains spaces. Shortcuts now appear correctly in Start Menu and "Recently installed".
- **Finish-page "Run program"** — Replaced `MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN` with `MUI_FINISHPAGE_RUN_FUNCTION` using `System::Call ShellExecuteW` to launch the app at normal user privilege instead of inheriting the installer's elevated admin token.
- **NumPy import crash** — Added `collect_all('numpy')` and explicit numpy submodules to PyInstaller spec to bundle all numpy 2.x internals, preventing `No module named 'numpy._core._exceptions'` on startup.
- **Driver page text clipping** — Reduced group box heights and repositioned elements so all text fits within the MUI2 dialog area without being cut off.

### Changed
- **Xbox Controller profile** — Removed Xbox Guide button and added dedicated Left Stick Click and Right Stick Click buttons for a cleaner layout.
- **Version consistency** — Updated `src/__init__.py` to show 1.4.3 throughout the application.

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-03-29 — *Renamed to Nimbus Adaptive Controller*

### Added
- **VS Code-style status ribbon** — Thin ribbon at the bottom of the main window displays the active output mode (Xbox/vJoy), current profile name, and connection status. Click the output mode label to switch between ViGEm and vJoy from the ribbon without opening any menu.
- **New Profile dialog** — Single combined dialog replacing the old two-step save-then-create flow. Enter profile name, optional description, and check/uncheck "save current profile first" — all in one step. Blank canvas is created on confirm; no widgets are inherited from the previous profile.
- **Recent Profiles menu** — File → Recent Profiles submenu shows the last 5 used profiles (most-recent first). Recent list is persisted in `controller_config.json` under `ui.recent_profiles` and survives application restarts.
- **Profile reload on switch** — `CustomLayout.qml` now listens to `profileChanged` and reloads `widgetModel`, `gridSnap`, and `showGrid` from the newly active profile immediately. Previously the canvas stayed blank after switching profiles.
- **Smart widget placement** — `_findFreePosition()` in `CustomLayout.qml` scans the canvas for a clear spot (AABB collision check, grid-snap step size) before placing a new widget from the palette. New widgets no longer drop on top of existing ones.
- **Bundled-profile save guard** — Clicking "Save Layout" while on a bundled profile (e.g., `adaptive_platform_2`) redirects to "Save Layout As..." so the bundled file cannot be accidentally overwritten.
- **`isBundledProfile()` bridge slot** — QML-callable slot that returns `true` when the active profile is a built-in bundled profile.
- **`createProfileAs()` bridge slot** — QML-callable slot creating a new blank profile (empty widget canvas, default settings) by name and description. Emits `profilesListChanged` so the profile menu updates immediately.
- **`getRecentProfiles()` bridge slot** — Returns the recent-profiles list (filtered to profiles that still exist on disk) as a `QVariantList` for QML.

### Changed
- **Widget palette window width** — Widened from 200 px to 240 px for better readability of ViGEm-mode labels.
- **ViGEm palette separation** — Widget palette shows context-specific controls based on output mode. ViGEm mode: Left Stick, Right Stick, LT/RT triggers, Xbox button presets, D-Pad with fixed IDs 11–14. vJoy mode: generic joystick, buttons, sliders, wheel, D-Pad with dynamic IDs.
- **Xbox button labels read-only** — In ViGEm mode the per-widget config dialog shows the fixed Xbox label (A/B/X/Y/LB/RB/Back/Start/LS/RS) as read-only text; numeric ID editing is only available in vJoy mode.
- **Joystick axis combos context-aware** — `sl0`/`sl1` axes are hidden from axis dropdowns in ViGEm mode (Xbox controller has no slider axes).
- **New profile starts blank** — `config.create_profile_as()` now produces a profile with `layout_type: "custom"`, an empty `widgets: []` canvas, and default sensitivity settings. It no longer copies widget layout or axis mappings from the current profile.
- **Recent profiles persistence** — `bridge.switchProfile()` writes the updated recent list to `config.set("ui.recent_profiles", ...)` and calls `config.save_config()` on every switch.

### Fixed
- **`ReferenceError: root is not defined` in `CustomLayout.qml`** — Delegate signal handlers (`onWidgetMoved`, `onWidgetResized`, etc.) referenced `root` but `DraggableWidget` also defines `id: root` internally. Fixed by adding `readonly property var layout: root` on the canvas `Rectangle` and using `canvas.layout` in all delegate signal handlers.
- **Scrollbar encroaching on palette content** — `ColumnLayout` inside the `Flickable` now subtracts `vsb.width` from its width so the attached `ScrollBar` overlay does not clip the rightmost edge of palette items.
- **`isViGEmAvailable` capitalization mismatch** — QML was calling `controller.isViGEmAvailable` but the bridge slot is `isVigemAvailable`. Corrected throughout `Main.qml`.

---

## [1.4.2] — 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Controller Monitor status bar** — Live controller output display at the bottom of the Nimbus window. Toggle via **View → Controller Monitor**. Shows all current axis values (LX, LY, RX, RY, LT, RT) and active buttons at 150ms refresh. Replaces the need for an external vJoy monitor when using ViGEm.
- **Individual axis selection for joystick widgets** — Axis Pair combo replaced with separate **X-Axis** and **Y-Axis** dropdowns in the widget config dialog. Each can independently be set to any axis (`x`, `y`, `rx`, `ry`, `z`, `rz`, `sl0`, `sl1`) or `None`. Enables mixed mappings like Left-Y + Right-X from a single joystick widget.
- **Per-axis invert toggles** — Each axis row in the joystick config dialog now has an **INV** button. When active (blue), that axis direction is flipped. Useful for games with inverted camera axes or for left-handed control schemes.
- **`getControllerStateText()` bridge slot** — Returns a formatted one-line summary of current ViGEm/vJoy axis and button state for the monitor bar.

### Fixed
- **Taskbar icon missing** — `WS_EX_APPWINDOW` is now explicitly set and `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW` cleared when Game Focus Mode is enabled. The Nimbus taskbar entry is always visible even with `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` active.
- **Can't bring Nimbus to foreground** — Game Focus Mode (`WS_EX_NOACTIVATE`) was being persisted to config via `startFullGameMode`, so it was active on every startup even outside game sessions. It is now session-only: enabled automatically when Full Game Mode starts, disabled when it stops, and never saved to the profile config.
- **Axis + Button macro not moving** — The keep-alive pulse loop (`mouse_hider.py`) was calling `left_joystick_float(micro_x, micro_y)` every 33ms, overwriting any macro-set axis value (e.g. LY:+1.0 for forward movement). The pulse now saves the current axis state from `ViGEmInterface.current_values`, adds the tiny oscillation delta on top, then immediately restores the saved values. Jump + movement now work simultaneously.
- **Axis + Button macro action not saving** — `_saveCurrentZone` in `MacroEditorDialog.qml` was missing `"axis_button"` from its action array (index 5 out of bounds → saved `undefined`). Execution code was already correct but never reached because the saved action was `undefined`.

### Changed
- **`start_controller_mode()` now accepts `vigem_interface` parameter** — The pulse loop and mouse hook burst both save/restore the full left + right stick state through this reference, preventing any pulse from clobbering gameplay axis values.
- **Game Focus Mode restore key changed** — `setWindow` now checks `ui.no_focus_mode_user` (explicit user setting) instead of `ui.no_focus_mode` (which was set by game mode auto-enable). Existing profiles with a stale `ui.no_focus_mode: true` will no longer force `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` at startup.

---

## [1.4.1] — 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Controller Mode Enforcement** — New approach to mouse capture that makes games *voluntarily* release the cursor. Instead of fighting `ClipCursor` in a race condition, Nimbus sends continuous controller keep-alive signals through ViGEm so the game thinks only a gamepad is connected and stops capturing the mouse.
- **`src/mouse_hider.py`** — Pure `ctypes` module implementing:
  - Controller keep-alive pulse (configurable 5–120 Hz) with sub-deadzone stick oscillations
  - Initial controller burst to force games into controller mode on startup
  - `WH_MOUSE_LL` hook that detects mouse-over-game and immediately counters with controller input
  - Integrated `ClipCursor(NULL)` release alongside controller pulse
- **`startControllerMode()` / `stopControllerMode()`** — New bridge slots for QML
- **`sendControllerBurst()`** — One-shot burst to force controller mode without continuous keep-alive
- **`startFullGameMode()` / `stopFullGameMode()`** — Recommended one-call approach combining focus mode + cursor release + controller mode enforcement
- **One-click "Start Game Mode" button** — Visible in bottom-right corner of main window. Opens a window picker (filtered to hide browsers/system apps), click your game, everything starts automatically.
- **ViGEm diagnostics** — Picker popup shows red warning if ViGEmBus driver is not installed
- **Controller mode statistics** — Track pulses sent, mouse events detected, bursts fired
- **ViGEmBus driver in installer** — NSIS installer now detects and offers to download/install the ViGEmBus driver alongside vJoy
- **Research doc** — `research/in-progress/controller-mode-enforcement.md` documenting the dual-input-detection exploit

### Changed
- **Mouse capture strategy** — Shifted from pure `ClipCursor(NULL)` racing to a combined approach: controller mode enforcement (primary) + cursor release (fallback). Games that detect Xbox input will voluntarily release the mouse, eliminating the race condition entirely.
- **Game Focus Mode rewritten** — Now uses true `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` window style instead of save/restore approach. Clicking Project Nimbus **never** steals focus from the game — no more pause menus triggering on click.
- **`startFullGameMode()` auto-enables Game Focus Mode** — No need to enable separately from View menu.
- **`startFullGameMode()` no longer calls `make_borderless()`** — This was reshaping/minimizing games. Game Mode now only starts focus mode + cursor release + controller mode enforcement; leave the game window as-is.
- **ViGEm gamepad created on demand** — Game Mode now creates a ViGEm gamepad regardless of profile type, so controller mode enforcement works even with flight_sim profiles.
- **Installer updated** — Driver page now shows both vJoy and ViGEmBus with detection and silent installation.

### Fixed
- **Clicking Nimbus caused game to pause** — The old Game Focus Mode briefly transferred focus to Nimbus before restoring it. Games like Minecraft detected the focus loss and opened the pause menu. Fixed by using `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` + `WM_MOUSEACTIVATE` native event filter so focus never leaves the game at all.
- **Raw Input mouse still moved game camera** — Games using Raw Input (Satisfactory, Unreal Engine titles) received mouse delta movement even when the cursor was outside the game window. The `WH_MOUSE_LL` hook now **suppresses** mouse-move events when the cursor is over the game window, blocking Raw Input from seeing them.
- **Games not switching to controller mode** — Controller burst amplitude was too small (0.05) to exceed Unreal Engine's deadzone (0.25). Increased burst amplitude to 0.5 and added A-button press during burst for unambiguous controller detection.
- **Game Mode picked wrong window** — Auto-detect fallback picked Microsoft Edge instead of the game. Replaced with a filtered window picker popup.
- **Game Mode minimized the game** — `make_borderless()` reshaped the game window, causing it to disappear. Removed from Game Mode flow.
- **Controller mode silently skipped** — If profile didn't use ViGEm (e.g., flight_sim), no gamepad existed and controller mode was silently not started. Fixed: ViGEm gamepad is now created on demand.

### Technical Notes
- Controller keep-alive sends stick oscillations (amplitude 0.08) that are below most games' deadzones (0.15–0.3) but large enough that UE/Unity input detection registers them
- The `WH_MOUSE_LL` hook now suppresses mouse-move events over the game window (returns 1 to block) while passing through events over Nimbus — this prevents Raw Input camera movement
- `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` + `QAbstractNativeEventFilter` for `WM_MOUSEACTIVATE` → `MA_NOACTIVATE` keeps Qt mouse handling working while preventing window activation
- Requires ViGEmBus driver — installer now handles installation automatically
- **Status: Work in progress** — Controller mode enforcement may not work with all games yet

## [1.4.0] — 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Borderless Gaming Integration** — Built-in borderless window mode + continuous `ClipCursor(NULL)` release. No external tools needed. Access via **View → Borderless Gaming...**
- **Auto-detect games** — Identifies 30+ known games from a built-in compatibility database (`src/borderless.py`)
- **One-click workflow** — Green "Apply Borderless + Free Cursor" button applies both simultaneously
- **Adjustable release speed** — Tune polling interval from 16ms (aggressive) to 200ms (gentle)
- **Compatibility browser** — In-app tab showing verified/likely/partial/incompatible games with filter buttons
- **`src/borderless.py`** — Pure `ctypes` module: window enumeration, borderless conversion, cursor release polling, game compat database, auto-detect
- **`qml/components/BorderlessGamingDialog.qml`** — Full-featured game setup + compatibility dialog
- **`docs/GAME_COMPATIBILITY.md`** — Documented game list with genre tips and setup guidance
- **QML/PySide6 UI** — Complete rewrite of the user interface using Qt Quick (QML) with a dark-themed, scalable layout
- **Game Focus Mode** — View menu toggle that restores focus to the game after each interaction using Windows thread-input attachment
- **ViGEm auto-selection** — Automatically uses Xbox 360 (XInput) for xbox/adaptive/custom profiles and vJoy (DirectInput) for flight sim
- **Smooth axis interpolation** — EMA-based smoothing timer at the vJoy update rate (default 60 Hz, configurable up to 240 Hz)
- **Profile system overhaul** — Full create, save, save-as, duplicate, delete, reset-to-defaults from File menu; stored in `%APPDATA%\ProjectNimbus`
- **About dialog** — Dynamic version, description, copyright, and license info in Help menu

### Changed
- **Single default profile** — Removed `flight_simulator`, `xbox_controller`, and `adaptive_platform_1` bundled profiles. `adaptive_platform_2` (Custom Layout Builder) is now the only bundled profile and opens on first launch
- **Default fallback** — `config.py` now falls back to `adaptive_platform_2` instead of `flight_simulator` everywhere

---

## [1.3.1] — 2026-03-03

### Changed
- **Versioned distribution filenames** — Executable and installer now include the version number in their filename (`Project-Nimbus-1.3.1.exe`, `Project-Nimbus-Setup-1.3.1.exe`) for clearer release management
- **Code-signed release** — EV certificate signed with SHA-256 timestamping via DigiCert

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-01-20

### Added
- **Macro Joystick Mode** — Convert any joystick widget into a macro trigger: each of 8 directional zones (plus center) maps to a configurable button press, axis value, or turbo action
- **Visual zone editor** — 8-zone + center joystick diagram in the per-widget config dialog for visually assigning actions to each direction
- **Quick presets** — One-click presets in the macro editor: ABXY face buttons, D-Pad directions, Triggers, and Shoulder buttons
- **Turbo mode** — Auto-fire any button at a configurable rate (1–30 Hz) from within the macro zone editor
- **vJoy auto-detection** — Detects whether vJoy is installed at startup and shows a guided prompt if it is missing

---

## [1.2.1] — 2025-02-15

### Added
- **Wheelchair joystick support (FPS-style delta tracking)** — When a joystick is locked, the cursor is hidden and continuously warped back to the joystick center. Each mouse movement is treated as a delta offset, scaled by a configurable sensitivity multiplier. This maps physical wheelchair joystick deflection directly to virtual joystick deflection.
- **Tremor Filter** — Per-joystick EMA smoothing (0-10) to reduce jittery input from wheelchair joysticks with involuntary tremor
- **Lock Sensitivity slider** — Per-joystick sensitivity (1-10, default 4) controlling how much physical mouse movement is needed for full virtual deflection
- **Auto-return to center** — Per-joystick toggle; when locked mode mouse stops, virtual joystick snaps back to center. Configurable delay (1-10ms) for fine-tuning response feel.
- **Copy sensitivity from dropdown** — Per-widget axis settings can copy sensitivity/deadzone/extremity from other axis widgets
- **Help menu documentation** — In-app "Getting Started" guide and "Feature Guide" accessible via Help menu with comprehensive wheelchair joystick setup instructions
- **Loading splash screen** — Dark-themed splash screen with logo, version, and progress messages shown during startup
- **Scrollbars on all settings dialogs** — QML config dialog, Button Settings, and Axis Settings all have styled scrollbars
- **DPI-aware cursor positioning** — Uses Qt's `QCursor.setPos()` instead of Windows `SetCursorPos` for correct behavior on scaled displays

### Changed
- **Edit Layout is a top-level menu** — Dedicated "Edit Layout" menu in the menu bar (custom layouts only), deferred loading to prevent startup flash
- **Axis Configuration and Button Modes hidden for custom layouts** — These legacy dialogs only appear for non-custom layout profiles; custom layouts use per-widget settings instead
- **Widget Palette title cleanup** — Removed duplicate "Widget Palette" heading inside the palette content since the window title bar already shows it
- **Docs folder reorganized** — Documentation now organized into subdirectories: `setup/`, `architecture/`, `development/`, `accessibility/`
- **Installer improvements** — Optional prompt to remove user data on uninstall; user profiles in `%APPDATA%` preserved by default across reinstalls

---

## [1.2.0] — 2025-02-14

### Added
- **Windows Installer (NSIS)** — Full installer with desktop/start menu shortcuts, uninstall support, previous-version detection
- **Code-signed executable** — EV certificate signing with SHA-256 timestamping for instant SmartScreen trust
- **UIAccess manifest** — `uiAccess="true"` for on-screen keyboard parity (requires signed exe in trusted location)
- **Vertical Slider widget** — Separate "V Slider" in palette (tall & narrow, bottom-to-top fill)
- **Slider click mode** — Per-slider "Jump to position" vs "Relative drag" option in config dialog
- **Dark-themed ComboBox dropdowns** — All config dialog dropdowns now have proper dark styling with blue highlight

### Fixed
- **Config dialog Apply button hidden** — Moved Cancel/Apply buttons outside the Flickable so they're always visible at the bottom of the dialog regardless of content height
- **"Profile saved" spam** — Removed `profileSaved.emit()` from auto-save; only explicit saves trigger the notification now
- **Vertical slider rendering** — Fixed QML anchor conflicts in fill rectangles by using pure x/y/width/height (no conditional anchors)
- **Widget property changes not applying** — Changed Repeater to use `model: root.widgetModel` with `modelData` and `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` deep copy for reliable delegate recreation
- **Repeater delegate scope** — Prefixed helper function calls with `root.` to fix `ReferenceError` when using array model

### Changed
- **Slider palette split** — Replaced single "Slider" button with "H Slider" (horizontal) and "V Slider" (vertical) in the widget palette
- **Orientation is read-only** — Orientation is determined at creation time by palette choice; config dialog shows it as informational text instead of a dropdown

---

## [1.0.1] — 2025-12-01

### Added
- **Custom Layout System** — Drag-and-drop widget canvas with 5 widget types: Joystick, Button, Slider, D-Pad, Steering Wheel
- **Widget Palette** — Pop-out tool window with smart auto-assignment of axes and button IDs
- **Per-widget config dialog** — Label, axis mapping, sensitivity, deadzone, extremity deadzone, snap mode, toggle mode, triple-click lock
- **Triple-click mouse lock** — Lock joystick to follow mouse cursor; triple-click again to release (returns to center)
- **Response curve preview** — Real-time graph in config dialog matching exact backend formula
- **Save Layout As** — Save custom layouts with custom names for different games

### Fixed
- **Widget palette overlap** — Moved palette to external pop-out window
- **Mouse lock edge sticking** — Full-canvas overlay tracks mouse without boundary issues
