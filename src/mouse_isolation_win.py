"""
Windows mouse isolation: talk to the Nimbus Mouse Filter kernel driver.

This is the Windows counterpart of the Linux ``EVIOCGRAB`` module
(``src/mouse_isolation.py`` on the ``linux-uinput-support`` branch, not yet
merged into ``main``), and it presents the **same** ``MouseIsolation`` class.
:mod:`src.bridge` imports it under try/except into ``MOUSE_ISOLATION_AVAILABLE``
and drives it from Full Game Mode (``startMouseIsolation`` /
``stopMouseIsolation``); the Linux module slots into the same names when that
branch merges. Where Linux grabs the evdev node directly, here the kernel
filter (``driver/nimbus_moufilter``) withholds physical mouse packets from
``mouclass`` and hands them to this process through ``\\\\.\\NimbusMouseFilter``.

While isolation is on, Windows itself stops seeing the physical mouse (cursor,
Raw Input, and every application, including a game). What happens next is the
caller's choice:

* **Software cursor** (``cursor_relay=False``, the Linux model): the bridge
  draws its own cursor and synthesises Qt events from the deltas delivered
  here (see the F4 note in ``docs/vision/LINUX_PROBE_PLAN.md``).
* **Cursor relay** (``cursor_relay=True``, the Windows Full Game Mode model):
  the reader thread applies every captured motion packet to the real Windows
  cursor with ``SetCursorPos``, which moves the cursor **without creating an
  input event**: no ``WM_INPUT``, no ``WH_MOUSE_LL`` event, only
  ``WM_MOUSEMOVE`` for the window under the cursor (measured in
  ``docs/vision/HOST_MODE_ISOLATION.md``, section 8.5). The desktop and Nimbus
  keep a normal, usable cursor, the game keeps the foreground, and the game's
  Raw Input stream is empty. Buttons and the wheel are **not** relayed by this
  module: they arrive through ``on_button`` and ``on_wheel`` as before, and the
  bridge decides per click (synthesised Qt events over Nimbus's own window;
  :func:`inject_button` and :func:`inject_wheel` elsewhere), because anything
  injected with ``SendInput`` does become Raw Input.

Button codes reported to ``on_button`` are the Linux evdev codes
(``BTN_LEFT`` = 0x110, ...) so the bridge's button map from the Linux branch
applies unchanged.

What the filter covers
----------------------
Every pointer that reports through ``mouclass``: USB and Bluetooth mice, PS/2,
and HID touchpads in legacy mouse mode. Precision Touchpads report through the
HID digitizer path straight to ``win32k`` and are expected to bypass the filter
(not yet measured on hardware). The driver's ``connected_mice`` counter says how
many devices it is attached to, and :meth:`MouseIsolation.start` refuses to
report success when that count is zero.

Availability
------------
``MOUSE_ISOLATION_AVAILABLE`` is True only when this is Windows **and** the
driver's control device existed when this module was imported (it may have
been held by another process at that moment; that still counts as installed).
A Windows machine without the driver therefore looks to the bridge exactly like
a Linux machine without evdev access, and the existing ``mouse_hider`` path
stays in charge of Game Mode. After installing the driver, restart Nimbus.
:meth:`MouseIsolation.start` does not depend on the import-time result: it
opens the device again and raises ``RuntimeError`` with a specific message if
the driver is missing or another process holds it.

Safety
------
* The driver clears isolation when this process's handle closes (crash, kill,
  exit) and via its own 2 s watchdog. Since interface v3 the watchdog counts
  only read *arrivals* as life: a read parked for ``TICK_MS`` with nothing to deliver
  is completed empty (a tick, ``ticks`` counts them) and the reader issues the
  next one, so a Nimbus that is frozen or suspended stops re-issuing and loses
  the mouse within 2 s of its last read. Once isolation is off the driver
  fails every read with ``ERROR_NOT_READY``, so the reader thread exits and
  ``on_stopped`` fires instead of the cursor going dead.
* :meth:`MouseIsolation.stop` is idempotent and registered with :mod:`atexit`.
* ``Ctrl+Alt+F12`` releases when ``hotkey`` is True (the default, as on
  Linux). It is polled on the reader thread with ``GetAsyncKeyState`` every
  ``HOTKEY_POLL_MS``, both while a read is parked and between reads, so a
  mouse that never stops moving (every read completing at once) cannot starve
  it. It works when the UI thread is stuck and needs no focus. The driver
  never touches the keyboard.

Requirements
------------
The Nimbus Mouse Filter driver installed and started (``driver/install-dev.ps1``
during development). The driver's interface version must match
``INTERFACE_VERSION``; :meth:`MouseIsolation.start` refuses a mismatch.

    Callbacks run on the reader thread; marshal to the UI thread before
    touching Qt objects (the bridge does this with queued signals).

    Args:
        on_motion: ``(dx, dy)`` per input report with movement, in pixels.
            Absolute-position devices (RDP, VM pointers, tablets in mouse
            mode) are converted to deltas against their previous position.
        on_button: ``(code, pressed)`` for mouse buttons (evdev codes).
        on_wheel: ``(horizontal, vertical)`` whole wheel notches; high
            resolution wheels accumulate until a notch is complete.
        on_stopped: ``(reason)`` when isolation ends for any reason, including
            ``"released by driver watchdog"`` when the driver gave the mouse
            back because this process stopped reading, and
            ``"emergency hotkey"`` for ``Ctrl+Alt+F12``.
