# Game Compatibility — Borderless Gaming & Mouse Capture

Project Nimbus includes built-in borderless gaming support that lets you free your cursor from games that lock it, so you can interact with the Nimbus controller interface while gaming.

## How It Works

Games capture the mouse using one of three mechanisms:

| Mechanism | How Nimbus Handles It |
|---|---|
| **ClipCursor** — game confines cursor to its window rect | Nimbus continuously releases the clip via polling (`ClipCursor(NULL)`) |
| **Exclusive Fullscreen** — game takes over the display | Nimbus converts the window to borderless windowed mode |
| **Raw Input** — game reads mouse delta directly from HID | Use **Controller Mode** (see below) — requires Raw Input: OFF in game settings |

## Access

**View → Borderless Gaming...** opens the control panel where you can:
- Auto-detect running games from our compatibility database
- Select any window and convert it to borderless fullscreen
- Toggle continuous cursor release on/off
- Adjust the release polling speed

---

## Controller Mode Enforcement (Full Game Mode)

**Full Game Mode** is a more powerful alternative to simple cursor release. Use it when the game camera still moves with the mouse even after cursor release is enabled.

### How it works

1. **ViGEm keep-alive pulse**: Sends a continuous stream of tiny sub-deadzone Xbox 360 controller inputs so the game stays in "controller mode" and voluntarily releases the mouse
2. **WH_MOUSE_LL hook**: Installs a system-wide low-level mouse hook that suppresses `WM_MOUSEMOVE` events over the game window — the camera receives zero mouse delta
3. **ClipCursor release**: Fights the game's cursor confinement at 2ms polling so you can still reach the Nimbus window

### Requirements
- **ViGEmBus driver** must be installed (Project Nimbus prompts for this automatically)
- **Raw Input: OFF** in the game's mouse/video settings — `WH_MOUSE_LL` intercepts `WM_MOUSEMOVE` but cannot intercept `WM_INPUT` (raw device events)
- Game must be in **windowed or borderless** mode (not exclusive fullscreen)

### Emergency stop
Press **Ctrl+Alt+F12** at any time to instantly kill Controller Mode and restore normal mouse behavior. This hotkey works even if Nimbus doesn't have focus.

### Which games benefit from Controller Mode?
Any game that:
- Uses a standard Windows message loop for mouse input (most games)
- Has a "Raw Input" or "DirectInput" toggle in settings (switch it OFF)
- Supports XInput controllers natively (detects the virtual Xbox 360 pad)

**Games that will NOT work** even with Controller Mode:
- Games with kernel-level anti-cheat (Vanguard, EAC) — the hook gets blocked
- Games that use Raw Input exclusively with no toggle option

### How it generalizes across game engines

| Engine | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Java (Minecraft)** | Raw Input toggle in Mouse Settings. Set Raw Input: OFF. Works perfectly. |
| **Unity** | Most Unity games use `WM_MOUSEMOVE`. No setting change needed. |
| **Unreal Engine** | Has a "Raw Input" or "Use Mouse for Touch" option — disable raw input. |
| **Source Engine** | `m_rawinput 0` in console disables raw input. Works with Controller Mode. |
| **GameMaker** | Uses standard WM_MOUSEMOVE. No setting change needed. |
| **Godot** | Uses standard WM_MOUSEMOVE. No setting change needed. |
| **XNA / MonoGame / FNA** | Uses standard WM_MOUSEMOVE. No setting change needed. |

## Verified Games

These games have been tested and confirmed working with Project Nimbus.

| Game | Method | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Minecraft (Java Edition)** | Controller Mode | Set Raw Input: OFF in Options → Controls → Mouse Settings. Use Full Game Mode. |
| **Stardew Valley** | ClipCursor | XNA/MonoGame engine. Very accessible with controller support. |
| **Terraria** | ClipCursor | XNA/MonoGame engine. Great accessibility with controller support. |
| **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim** | ClipCursor | Set to windowed mode in launcher. Full controller support via ViGEm/vJoy. |

## Likely Compatible Games

High confidence based on engine analysis. These games use ClipCursor and should work well.

| Game | Input Method | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **No Man's Sky** | ClipCursor | Has native borderless option. Excellent controller support — use ViGEm Xbox profile. |
| **Celeste** | ClipCursor | XNA/FNA engine. Strong controller support. Excellent built-in accessibility features. |
| **Hollow Knight** | ClipCursor | Unity engine. Good controller support. |
| **Hades** | ClipCursor | Custom engine with standard windowing. Excellent controller support. |
| **Slay the Spire** | ClipCursor | Java/LibGDX. Turn-based — very accessible for adaptive controllers. |
| **Civilization VI** | ClipCursor | Turn-based strategy — ideal for adaptive controllers. Has native borderless option. |
| **Factorio** | ClipCursor | Pausable — great for players who need extra time. |
| **Among Us** | ClipCursor | Unity engine. Simple controls — very accessible. |
| **Undertale / Deltarune** | ClipCursor | GameMaker engine. Simple controls. Excellent for adaptive play. |
| **Cuphead** | ClipCursor | Unity engine. Excellent controller support. |
| **Rocket League** | ClipCursor | Unreal Engine. Has built-in borderless option. Use ViGEm Xbox profile. |
| **Fall Guys** | ClipCursor | Unity engine. Good controller support. |
| **The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth** | ClipCursor | Roguelike — no penalty for taking time. |
| **Portal / Portal 2** | ClipCursor | Source engine. Puzzler — can be paused freely. |

## Partially Compatible Games

Some features work, with limitations.

| Game | Input Method | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Elden Ring** | ClipCursor + Raw Input | Use controller mode (ViGEm) — mouse camera won't work. Set to windowed in settings. |
| **Dark Souls III** | ClipCursor + Raw Input | Similar to Elden Ring — use controller mode. Set to windowed in settings first. |

## Incompatible Games

These games use Raw Input exclusively. External cursor release has no effect. Use a second monitor, tablet input device, or game streaming instead.

| Game | Why |
|---|---|
| **Valorant** | Raw Input + Vanguard anti-cheat |
| **Counter-Strike 2** | Raw Input + VAC anti-cheat |
| **Fortnite** | Raw Input + EasyAntiCheat |
| **Apex Legends** | Raw Input + EasyAntiCheat |
| **Overwatch 2** | Raw Input exclusively |

## General Guidelines

### Best Game Genres for Adaptive Controllers
- **Turn-based games** (Civilization, Slay the Spire) — no time pressure
- **Sandbox/creative** (Minecraft, Stardew Valley, Terraria) — relaxed pace
- **Puzzle games** (Portal) — pausable, thoughtful gameplay
- **Platformers with controller support** (Celeste, Hollow Knight) — designed for gamepad
- **Racing** (Rocket League) — joystick maps naturally

### Tips
1. **Always set the game to windowed mode first** before applying borderless
2. **Use Game Focus Mode** (View → Game Focus Mode) alongside borderless for best results
3. **Lower the cursor release interval** (16–30ms) if the game keeps re-locking your cursor
4. **Use ViGEm Xbox profile** for games with native XInput support (most modern games)

### Reporting New Games
If you test a game that works (or doesn't), please open an issue on our GitHub repository with:
- Game name and version
- Whether borderless mode worked
- Whether cursor release was needed
- Any notes about controller compatibility
