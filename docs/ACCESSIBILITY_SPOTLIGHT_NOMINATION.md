## 3. Please describe the Accessibility Spotlight you are nominating

Project Nimbus is an open-source virtual controller interface that transforms mouse input into virtual joystick commands via the vJoy driver. Built with an accessibility-first philosophy, it enables users who cannot operate traditional physical controllers—such as joysticks or gamepads—to control any software or hardware that expects joystick input.

The project features multiple controller layouts including an Adaptive Platform profile specifically designed for accessibility, with larger buttons, clear Greek symbol labels (α, Ω, β), and prominent L3/R3 stick click buttons. Key accessibility features include:

- **Mouse-driven joystick control** with customizable sensitivity curves and deadzones
- **Toggle mode for buttons** eliminating the need to hold buttons down
- **Individual axis locking** to simplify control for users with limited mobility
- **Game Focus Mode** to maintain game input while interacting with the controller interface
- **Comprehensive profile system** for saving personalized configurations
- **Steam Input integration** for XInput-compatible games

This is significant because it bridges the gap between alternative input devices and applications that only support traditional joystick input, opening up flight simulators, adaptive gaming, UAV control software, and countless other applications to users who were previously excluded.

## 4. What impact did this Accessibility Spotlight have for people with disabilities?

Project Nimbus removes barriers for individuals with mobility impairments who rely on mouse, trackball, or other adaptive pointing devices. Previously, these users faced significant challenges using:

- Flight simulators and driving games that require dual-stick input
- UAV/drone ground control software like Mission Planner
- Any application expecting traditional gamepad input

The **toggle button mode** is particularly impactful—users no longer need to continuously hold buttons, reducing fatigue and enabling participation in games/applications that require sustained button presses.

The **customizable sensitivity curves and deadzone settings** allow fine-tuning for users with tremors or limited fine motor control, while the **axis locking feature** simplifies complex multi-axis control into manageable single-axis movements.

By working with Steam Input, Project Nimbus extends accessibility to the entire Steam game library for XInput-compatible titles.
