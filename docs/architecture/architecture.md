# Project Nimbus Architecture

## Current Ownership Boundaries

The application now composes `ApplicationServices`, `ControllerOutput`, and
`ProfileRepository` behind the existing `ControllerBridge`. See
[Application Ownership Restructuring](APPLICATION_OWNERSHIP.md) for the current
responsibilities, compatibility constraints, test commands, and deferred work.
QML service commands and properties go through `controller`; cloud, telemetry,
and updater implementations are no longer separate production context objects.

## High-Level Overview

Project Nimbus is a Python-based modular virtual controller that converts mouse/GUI input into joystick commands via **vJoy** (DirectInput) or **ViGEm** (Xbox 360 XInput emulation). The UI is implemented with **Qt Quick (PySide6 + QML)**, backed by a Python core that manages configuration, sensitivity curves, profiles, and controller I/O.

The project's goal is to be a **free, open-source software Xbox Adaptive Controller** — enabling users with physical disabilities to build fully custom controller layouts without expensive hardware.

### Data Flow

```
User (mouse) → QML UI → ControllerBridge (Python) → ControllerConfig (curves/mapping)
                                                   → VJoyInterface or ViGEmInterface
                                                   → Virtual Controller Driver
                                                   → Game / Application
```

## Launch Flow

### 1. Top-Level Launcher (`run.py`)

- Performs Python version checks and virtual environment setup.
- Ensures dependencies (PySide6, pyvjoy, numpy, etc.) are installed.
- Launches the QML application module: `python run.py` → runs `src.qt_qml_app` in the venv.
- For bundled executables, `build_tools/launcher.py` is used instead.

### 2. QML Application Entry (`src/qt_qml_app.py`)

- Creates `QApplication` and `QQmlApplicationEngine`.
- Instantiates `ControllerConfig` and `ControllerBridge`.
- Exposes to QML as context properties: `controller` and `config`.
- Loads `qml/Main.qml` and starts the Qt event loop.

### 3. QML UI (`qml/`)

`Main.qml` defines the main window, menu bar, profile system, and a **layout loader** that switches between layout components based on profile `layout_type`:

| Layout Type | QML Component | Description |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| `custom` | `CustomLayout.qml` | **★ Default — modular drag-and-drop canvas** |
| `flight_sim` | `FlightSimLayout.qml` | Fixed dual joysticks + throttle/rudder (legacy) |
| `xbox` | `XboxLayout.qml` | Fixed Xbox gamepad layout (legacy) |
| `adaptive` | `AdaptiveLayout.qml` | Fixed accessibility-focused layout (legacy) |

### 4. Controller Interface Selection

The bridge auto-selects the controller backend based on profile layout type:
- **ViGEm** (preferred for `custom`) — Xbox 360 emulation for XInput games
- **vJoy** (fallback) — DirectInput with 8 axes + 128 buttons

---

## Custom Layout System (Adaptive Platform 2)

The `custom` layout type is the architectural centerpiece of the modular controller builder. Instead of hardcoded widget positions, everything is driven by a JSON widget array stored in the profile.

### Architecture

```
Profile JSON                    QML Rendering
─────────────                   ─────────────
custom_layout.widgets[] ──→ CustomLayout.qml (canvas)
  ├── {type: "joystick", ...}       ├── Repeater over widget model
  ├── {type: "button", ...}         ├── DraggableWidget.qml (per widget)
  ├── {type: "slider", ...}         │   ├── Edit mode: drag/resize/delete/config
  └── ...                           │   └── Play mode: interactive control
                                    ├── WidgetPalette.qml (sidebar, edit mode only)
                                    └── Widget Config Dialog (double-click)
```

### Widget Schema

Each widget in `custom_layout.widgets[]` has:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Unique identifier (e.g. `"left_stick"`, `"btn_a"`) |
| `type` | string | `"joystick"`, `"button"`, `"slider"`, `"dpad"`, `"wheel"` |
| `x`, `y` | number | Position on canvas (pixels, grid-snapped) |
| `width`, `height` | number | Size (pixels, grid-snapped) |
| `label` | string | Display label |

**Type-specific fields:**

- **Joystick**: `mapping.axis_x`, `mapping.axis_y` (e.g. `"x"/"y"`, `"rx"/"ry"`, `"sl0"/"sl1"`)
- **Button**: `button_id` (1–128), `color` (hex), `shape` (`"circle"/"rounded"/"square"`), `toggle_mode`
- **Slider**: `mapping.axis` (e.g. `"z"`, `"rz"`, `"sl0"`), `orientation` (`"horizontal"`/`"vertical"`), `snap_mode` (`"none"`/`"left"`/`"center"`), `click_mode` (`"jump"`/`"relative"`)
- **D-Pad**: `mapping` with `up`/`down`/`left`/`right` button IDs
- **Wheel**: `mapping.axis` (single rotational axis)

### Edit Mode vs. Play Mode

| Feature | Edit Mode | Play Mode |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Drag widgets | ✅ | ❌ |
| Resize widgets | ✅ | ❌ |
| Delete widgets | ✅ | ❌ |
| Config dialog (double-click) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Widget Palette (pop-out window) | ✅ visible | ❌ hidden |
| Grid overlay | ✅ optional | ❌ hidden |
| Interactive controls | ❌ blocked | ✅ active |
| Selection border | ✅ blue outline | ❌ none |

### DraggableWidget.qml

The universal wrapper component. It:
1. Receives widget data as properties (`widgetType`, `widgetId`, `mapping`, etc.)
2. In edit mode: renders drag handle, resize handle, delete button, type label
3. In play mode: renders the interactive control via a `Loader` that selects the correct `Component`:
   - `joystickContent` — full joystick with thumb, base circle, axis output, triple-click mouse lock
   - `buttonContent` — colored button with toggle/momentary support
   - `sliderContent` — horizontal/vertical slider with 3 snap modes, jump/relative click, smooth snap-back easing, and fill bar
   - `dpadContent` — 4-directional button cluster with arrow symbols
   - `wheelContent` — rotational single-axis with spoke indicator
4. Exposes `joystickLocked`, `updateJoystickPosition()`, `triggerTripleClick()` for the parent overlay
5. Sends raw geometry only: `controller.setStickInput(widgetId, nx, ny)` for joysticks and `controller.setAxisInput(widgetId, value)` for sliders and wheels. All shaping happens in the bridge (see Sensitivity Curve below)

### Widget Palette (Pop-Out Window)

The palette is rendered as a separate `Window` with `Qt.FramelessWindowHint | Qt.WindowStaysOnTopHint`:
- Custom draggable title bar (dark blue, drag to reposition)
- Stays on top so it's always accessible
- Never overlaps the canvas since it's a separate OS window
- Auto-shows/hides with edit mode
- Contains: add widget buttons, axis limits info, toggle grid, save as, done editing

### Mouse Lock Overlay

When a joystick is triple-click locked, `CustomLayout.qml` shows a full-canvas `MouseArea` overlay:
- `hoverEnabled: true` — tracks mouse position without clicking
- Maps global coordinates to the locked joystick's local space via `mapToItem()`
- Calls `updateJoystickPosition(nx, ny)` on the locked widget
- Handles triple-click for unlock
- Joystick returns to center (0,0) when unlocked
- Fixes the edge-sticking bug from the old hover-based approach

### Sensitivity Curve (Per-Widget)

Each axis widget stores sensitivity settings as percentages (0–100), matching the Settings menu:
- `sensitivity` (50% = linear, <50% = exponential, >50% = responsive)
- `dead_zone` (0–100%, maps to 0–0.25 of axis range internally)
- `extremity_dead_zone` (0–100%, scales max output; sticks default to 5, sliders and wheels to 0)
- `anti_deadzone`, `anti_deadzone_buffer` (fractions): the output floor the smallest movement is lifted to, so a game's own inner deadzone does not swallow it. Defaults to the XInput constants under ViGEm
- `tremor_filter` (0–10), `precision_gain` (fraction), `travel_px` (pixels)

The single formula lives in `config.py` (`shape_magnitude`, `shape_vector`) and is applied by the bridge in `setStickInput` / `setAxisInput`, in this order: tremor EMA, precision gain, radial inner deadzone, power curve, then a remap of anything non-zero onto `[anti_deadzone + buffer, 1 - extremity]`. It is radial: the vector's magnitude is shaped and its direction kept, so the dead region is a circle, diagonals respond like cardinals, and the magnitude never exceeds 1. The bridge then flips Y (screen-down to controller-up), applies `invert_x` / `invert_y`, and routes to the widget's mapped axes. A release (0, 0) always snaps the output to centre regardless of the filter. The legacy layouts (`adaptive`, `xbox`, `flight_sim`) go through `setLeftStick` / `setRightStick`, which use the same function with the profile's global `joystick_settings`.

The config dialog's **Response Curve Preview** asks the bridge for its points (`shapeCurve`) so the preview and the runtime cannot drift, shows the smallest and largest output, and has a test pad (`previewStick`) that can drive the mapped stick for calibrating the anti-deadzone against a running game.

### Persistence

- Widget positions/sizes/config saved to profile JSON under `custom_layout`
- `ControllerConfig.save_custom_layout(widgets, grid_snap, show_grid)` writes to disk
- Bridge slots: `getCustomLayout()`, `saveCustomLayout()`, `saveCustomLayoutAs()`, `getCustomLayoutGridSnap()`, `getCustomLayoutShowGrid()`
- Auto-saves on every widget move/resize/config change and when exiting edit mode
- Save As dialog for creating named layout profiles

---

## Core Python Components

### `ControllerConfig` (`src/config.py`)

Configuration manager responsible for:
- Loading defaults and merging with `controller_config.json`
- `get`/`set` helpers with dot-notation paths (e.g. `"joystick_settings.sensitivity"`)
- Persisting settings to disk (`save_config`)
- **Profile system**: load/save/switch/duplicate/delete/reset profiles
- **Custom layout persistence**: `save_custom_layout()` for the modular canvas
- UI scaling utilities: `get_scaled_value`, `get_scaled_int`, `set_scale_factor`
- Input processing: sensitivity curves, deadzone/extremity handling, normalized-to-vJoy conversion

### `VJoyInterface` (`src/vjoy_interface.py`)

Wrapper around the vJoy driver (via `pyvjoy`):
- Supports **8 axes**: X, Y, Z, RX, RY, RZ, SL0, SL1
- Supports up to **128 buttons**
- APIs: `update_axis(axis, value)`, `set_button(button_id, pressed)`, `get_status()`
- Maps logical axis names to vJoy HID constants
- Handles initialization, validation, centering, and failsafe

### `ViGEmInterface` (`src/vigem_interface.py`)

Xbox 360 controller emulation via ViGEmBus, through the pure-Python bus client in `src/padbus_client.py` (no client package or DLL):
- **2 analog sticks** (left/right), **2 triggers** (LT/RT), **14 buttons**
- Compatible API with VJoyInterface: `update_axis()`, `set_button()`
- Auto-selected for `xbox`, `adaptive`, and `custom` layout types when available
- Provides XInput compatibility for games like No Man's Sky

### `X360Pad` (`src/padbus_client.py`)

The virtual pad itself, a pure-ctypes client for the ViGEmBus protocol (no client package, no DLL):
- Finds the bus device interface with cfgmgr32, opens it overlapped, and drives it with the bus's buffered IOCTLs (plug, wait ready, submit report, unplug)
- Keeps vgamepad's method names (`left_joystick_float`, `press_button`, `update`, `reset`) so the swap was mechanical
- Self-healing: skips serials whose child device is still present, proves a new pad with real reports, and re-plugs a pad whose device object has gone rather than letting it go silently dead (the bus quirk and the numbers are in `docs/vision/PAD_BUS_FORK_PLAN.md`, section 17)
- `PADBUS_AVAILABLE` is True only when a bus is present; the module imports cleanly anywhere

### `ControllerBridge` (`src/bridge.py`)

Qt `QObject` exposed to QML as `controller`:
- Owns `ControllerConfig` + controller interface (VJoy or ViGEm)
- **Properties**: `scaleFactor`, `debugBorders`, `buttonsVersion`, `noFocusMode`
- **Axis slots**: `setStickInput(widgetId, nx, ny)` and `setAxisInput(widgetId, value)` for custom-layout widgets (shaped from the widget's profile settings); `setLeftStick`, `setRightStick`, `setThrottle`, `setRudder`, `setAxis` for the legacy layouts and macro actions
- **Shaping helpers**: `setModifier(name, active)` / `isModifierActive` (the precision modifier), `shapeCurve(paramsJson)` and `previewStick(...)` for the config dialog, `defaultAntiDeadzone(axis)`
- **Button slot**: `setButton(id, pressed)`
- **Profile slots**: `switchProfile`, `saveCurrentProfile`, `createProfileAs`, `deleteProfile`
- **Custom layout slots**: `getCustomLayout`, `saveCustomLayout`, `getCustomLayoutGridSnap`, `getCustomLayoutShowGrid`
- **Settings dialog openers**: `openAxisSettings`, `openButtonSettings`, `openSliderSettings`
- **Borderless gaming slots**: `isBorderlessAvailable`, `getRunningWindows`, `getGameCompatibility`, `autoDetectGame`, `makeGameBorderless`, `restoreGameWindow`, `startCursorRelease`, `stopCursorRelease`, `applyBorderlessAndRelease`, `restoreAndStopRelease`
- **Axis smoothing**: QTimer-based interpolation toward target values before sending to vJoy

### `WindowUtils` (`src/window_utils.py`)

Windows-specific utilities for Game Focus Mode:
- Adds `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` to the Nimbus window and answers `WM_MOUSEACTIVATE` with `MA_NOACTIVATE`, so clicks never move the foreground away from the game
- Keeps `GetForegroundWindow` / `SetForegroundWindow` / `AttachThreadInput` helpers as a fallback for the rare activation that still happens (Alt+Tab)
- Only available on Windows; gracefully disabled on other platforms

### `Borderless` (`src/borderless.py`)

Borderless gaming and mouse capture (Windows only, pure ctypes):
- **`enumerate_windows()`** — lists all visible top-level windows with size/position/state
- **`make_borderless(hwnd)`** — strips WS_CAPTION/WS_THICKFRAME, resizes to fill monitor
- **`restore_window(hwnd)`** — restores original window style and size
- **`start_cursor_release(interval_ms)`** — background thread polling `ClipCursor(NULL)` to fight games that re-apply cursor confinement every frame
- **`stop_cursor_release()`** — stops polling
- **`auto_detect_game()`** — matches running windows against 30+ game compatibility entries
- **`GAME_COMPATIBILITY`** — built-in database of verified/likely/partial/incompatible games
- Exposed via 12 `ControllerBridge` slots (see bridge section above)
- UI: `qml/components/BorderlessGamingDialog.qml` — game picker, auto-detect, one-click apply, compatibility browser

### `MouseIsolation` (`src/mouse_isolation_win.py`) and the `driver/` filter

Mouse isolation is the answer to games that read the mouse through Raw Input, which neither cursor release nor the `WH_MOUSE_LL` hook can stop (measured in `docs/vision/HOST_MODE_ISOLATION.md`, section 8). It has two halves:

- **Kernel:** `driver/nimbus_moufilter`, a KMDF upper filter on the mouse class. Pass-through by default. While a client holds `\\.\NimbusMouseFilter` open with isolation on, physical mouse packets are withheld from `mouclass` and delivered to the client through `ReadFile`. Isolation is cleared when the client's handle closes and by a 2 s read watchdog; the keyboard is never filtered. Built with `driver\build.ps1` (needs the WDK); not part of `run.py`.
- **User mode:** `MouseIsolation(on_motion, on_button, on_wheel, on_stopped, hotkey, cursor_relay)`, the same class API as the Linux `src/mouse_isolation.py` on the `linux-uinput-support` branch (evdev button codes included) plus the Windows-only `cursor_relay`: the reader thread applies captured motion to the real cursor with `SetCursorPos`, which creates no input event, so the cursor keeps working everywhere while the game's Raw Input sees nothing and the game keeps the foreground. The bridge imports it under `MOUSE_ISOLATION_AVAILABLE` (True only when the driver's device exists) and starts it from Full Game Mode with a per-point policy (never over the game window unless that spot is Nimbus) and a per-window click policy (synthesised Qt events over Nimbus, `SendInput` elsewhere). `Ctrl+Alt+F12` is polled on the reader thread. `start()` raises `RuntimeError` with an install hint when the driver is absent and refuses to succeed when the driver is attached to no mouse.
- **Contract:** `driver/nimbus_moufilter/nimbus_moufilter_ioctl.h` and the constants at the top of `mouse_isolation_win.py` must change together.

Status: dev build validated on hardware on 2026-09-05 (a Raw Input window received nothing while the driver captured every packet), then interface v3 (a heartbeat so a frozen Nimbus loses the mouse within 2 s) under Driver Verifier, the cursor relay against Left 4 Dead 2, and the real app in Full Game Mode against a fake Raw Input game (`tests/probe_nimbus_relay_windows.py`, 8/8). Full Game Mode brings the game to the foreground itself and parks a cursor found over the game onto Nimbus, so the relay policy never leaves a physical mouse stuck. On 2026-09-06 the filter passed an unattended battle test (`tests/probe_mouse_filter_stress_windows.py`: storms, floods, process chaos, CPU starvation, an API fuzz, a soak; 15/15, also under Driver Verifier) and the static checks (WDK Code Analysis, CodeQL), which produced three fixes: the reader thread runs at time-critical priority so a busy game cannot starve it past the watchdog, two driver functions that take a spin lock left the pageable section, and interface v4 shortened the heartbeat tick to 250 ms so a live client survives a stall of at least 1.5 s. The client also pauses isolation while the lock screen or a UAC prompt has the input, since the relay cannot reach the secure desktop. Not attestation-signed, not in any release, not in the installer. See `docs/vision/WINDOWS_MOUSE_FILTER_PLAN.md`.

## Settings & Dialogs (`src/qt_dialogs.py`)

Qt Widgets-based dialogs invoked from the bridge:

| Dialog | Class | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Axis Configuration | `AxisSettingsQt` | Per-axis sensitivity, deadzone, VJoy mapping |
| Slider/Trigger Settings | `SliderSettingsQt` | Throttle/rudder or trigger sensitivity |
| Button Settings | `ButtonSettingsQt` | Toggle vs. momentary mode per button |

All dialogs read/write through `ControllerConfig` and persist to the current profile.

---

## Profile System

Profiles are JSON files stored in the user data directory:

| Platform | Location |
|----------|----------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\ProjectNimbus\profiles\` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/ProjectNimbus/profiles/` |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/ProjectNimbus/profiles/` |

### Bundled Profile

| Profile | Layout Type | Description |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `adaptive_platform_2` | `custom` | **Default — modular drag-and-drop canvas** |

This is the only bundled profile. It opens automatically on first launch. Users create additional profiles via **File > Save Profile As...** or the Widget Palette's Save As button.

### Profile Lifecycle

1. `adaptive_platform_2` copied to user directory on first run
2. User can modify, save, duplicate, or create new profiles
3. The bundled profile can be reset to defaults
4. Switching profiles reloads settings and swaps the QML layout

---

## Alternative Shells & Legacy Code

### Qt Widgets Shell (`src/qt_main.py`)
- Alternative (non-QML) interface for experimentation. Not the default entry point.

### Legacy Pygame UI (`src/legacy/`)
- Original pygame-based UI. Kept for reference only; not used by `run.py`.

---

## Build & Packaging

- **Source**: `python run.py` (sets up venv, installs deps, launches QML app)
- **Executable**: PyInstaller one-file build via `build_tools/build_exe.bat`
- **Installer**: NSIS installer via `build_tools/installer.nsi` (built automatically if NSIS is in PATH)
- **EV Signing**: `build_tools/sign_exe.bat` signs both exe and installer with SHA-256 + DigiCert timestamp
- **UIAccess**: `build_tools/Project-Nimbus.manifest` embeds `uiAccess="true"` for on-screen keyboard parity
- **Icon**: `build_tools/Project-Nimbus.ico` (multi-size: 16–256px)
- **Version**: Defined in `src/__init__.py`, `build_tools/version_info.txt`, and `build_tools/Project-Nimbus.spec`

### Build Workflow
```
build_exe.bat  →  PyInstaller (Project-Nimbus.exe)  →  NSIS (Project-Nimbus-Setup-X.Y.Z.exe)
sign_exe.bat   →  signtool signs both .exe files with EV cert + timestamp
```

See `build_tools/BUILD_EXECUTABLE.md` and `build_tools/CODE_SIGNING.md` for detailed steps.
