# VDroid — Custom Virtual Controller Driver Brainstorm

## The Problem

vJoy provides **8 axes** (X, Y, Z, RX, RY, RZ, SL0, SL1) per virtual device. That means a maximum of **4 two-axis joysticks**. For users who need 5+ joysticks, multiple sliders, and analog controls simultaneously, vJoy becomes the bottleneck — not our software.

ViGEm (Xbox 360 emulation) is even more constrained: **2 sticks + 2 triggers + 14 buttons**.

A custom virtual controller driver ("VDroid") would remove these limits entirely and let Project Nimbus scale to any number of axes, buttons, and input devices.

## What We'd Be Building

A **Windows kernel-mode or user-mode virtual HID device driver** that:
1. Presents one or more virtual joystick/gamepad devices to Windows
2. Exposes a user-mode API (DLL or named pipe) for our Python app to send axis/button data
3. Supports an arbitrary number of axes, buttons, and POV hats per device
4. Is recognized by DirectInput and ideally XInput-compatible games

---

## Architecture Options

### Option A: UMDF (User-Mode Driver Framework) HID Minidriver

**How it works:**
- Write a UMDF2 driver that implements a virtual HID device
- The driver presents a custom HID Report Descriptor defining N axes and M buttons
- A user-mode companion service or DLL accepts data from our Python app and passes it to the driver via IOCTL

**Pros:**
- User-mode = safer (crashes don't BSOD)
- Microsoft provides UMDF HID samples (e.g. `vhidmini2`)
- Easier to debug than kernel-mode
- Can be signed with a standard EV certificate

**Cons:**
- Still requires driver signing (EV cert + WHQL or attestation signing)
- UMDF has some latency overhead vs. kernel-mode
- Complex HID report descriptor authoring

**Effort:** Medium-high. Microsoft's `vhidmini2` sample is a starting point.

### Option B: KMDF (Kernel-Mode Driver Framework) HID Minidriver

**How it works:**
- Same concept as UMDF but runs in kernel space
- Lower latency, more control

**Pros:**
- Lowest possible latency
- Full control over HID descriptors and timing

**Cons:**
- Kernel-mode crash = BSOD
- Requires WHQL signing for Windows 10/11 (expensive, slow process)
- Much harder to develop and debug
- Needs a dedicated test machine or VM

**Effort:** High. Only justified if UMDF latency is insufficient.

### Option C: ViGEmBus Fork / Extension

**How it works:**
- Fork the ViGEmBus driver (open-source, kernel-mode)
- Add a new device type beyond Xbox 360 / DualShock 4
- Define a custom gamepad with more axes

**Pros:**
- Proven, production-tested driver framework
- Already handles device creation/destruction
- Community and documentation exist
- C codebase, well-structured

**Cons:**
- ViGEmBus is Xbox-specific in many places; extending it may fight the architecture
- Still kernel-mode with signing requirements
- ViGEm project is in maintenance mode (creator stepped back)
- XInput games may not recognize extra axes

**Effort:** Medium. Good if we want Xbox compatibility + extra axes.

### Option D: Virtual HID via HID over I2C / SPI Shim

**How it works:**
- Use Windows' built-in HID transport support
- Create a virtual I2C/SPI bus driver that injects HID reports
- The OS treats it as a real HID device

**Pros:**
- Leverages existing Windows HID infrastructure
- No custom HID minidriver needed (just the bus driver)

**Cons:**
- Very niche, poorly documented approach
- May not be stable across Windows versions
- Still needs driver signing

**Effort:** Medium, but risky due to sparse documentation.

### Option E: Multi-Device vJoy (No Custom Driver)

**How it works:**
- vJoy supports up to **16 virtual devices** (device IDs 1-16)
- Each device has 8 axes + 128 buttons
- We'd open multiple vJoy devices simultaneously

**Pros:**
- **No driver development needed** — just use existing vJoy
- 16 devices × 8 axes = **128 axes** (64 joysticks!)
- 16 devices × 128 buttons = **2048 buttons**
- Works today with current vJoy installation

**Cons:**
- Games typically only see one joystick device at a time
- Would need a "device combiner" or the game must support multi-device
- Some games and middleware (Steam Input) handle multiple devices fine
- Adds complexity to our bridge layer

**Effort:** **Low.** This is the pragmatic first step before writing a custom driver.

## HID Report Descriptor Deep Dive

The key to a custom driver is crafting the **HID Report Descriptor** — a binary blob that tells Windows "this device has N axes and M buttons."

  Clutch          (0xC6)
```

### What This Means

Windows HID supports **far more axis types** than vJoy exposes. A custom driver could define:
- 6 standard axes (X/Y/Z/RX/RY/RZ)
- 2+ sliders
- Throttle, rudder, aileron, elevator (simulation)
- Steering, accelerator, brake, clutch (driving)
- Velocity axes (Vx/Vy/Vz) for 3D spatial input
- Up to **65535 buttons** per HID report

Realistically, **32 axes + 256 buttons** in a single device would cover any conceivable accessibility use case.

## Recommended Path

### Phase 1: Multi-Device vJoy (Now)
- Open 2-4 vJoy devices from our bridge
- Map widgets to specific devices
- Test with games that support multiple controllers
- **Zero driver development, works today**

### Phase 2: UMDF Virtual HID (Future)
- Use Microsoft's `vhidmini2` sample as a starting point
- Define a custom HID report descriptor with 16-32 axes + 256 buttons
- Build a companion DLL with a simple API: `VDroidSetAxis(device, axis, value)`
- Write a Python ctypes wrapper
- Sign with our EV certificate (attestation signing for Windows 10+)

### Phase 3: XInput Compatibility Layer (Optional)
- If games need XInput, add a translation layer
- Maps first 2 joysticks to virtual Xbox sticks
- Rest of axes available via DirectInput
- Could extend ViGEmBus or build a standalone XInput wrapper

## Development Requirements

### For Phase 2 (Custom Driver)

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Language | C/C++ (WDK required) |
| SDK | Windows Driver Kit (WDK) |
| IDE | Visual Studio 2022 with WDK integration |
| Signing | EV code signing certificate (we have one) |
| Testing | WHQL test machine or Windows VM with test signing |
| Attestation | Microsoft Hardware Dev Center account for attestation signing |

### Signing Options

1. **Test Signing** — Enable test mode on dev machines, no cert needed
2. **Attestation Signing** — Submit driver to Microsoft's portal, signed by Microsoft (free with Hardware Dev Center account + EV cert)
3. **WHQL** — Full certification, expensive ($250+), guarantees compatibility

Since we already have an EV certificate, **attestation signing** is the pragmatic path. It's free and Microsoft signs the driver for us.

## Key Questions to Resolve

1. **Do games actually need more than 8 axes on a single device?** Or is multi-device vJoy sufficient?
2. **What's the minimum viable axis count?** 16 axes (8 joysticks) covers most cases.
3. **Is XInput compatibility essential?** Many accessibility-focused games use DirectInput.
4. **Should VDroid be a standalone project or embedded in Nimbus?** Standalone would benefit the wider accessibility community.
5. **Can we partner with vJoy maintainers** to upstream extended axis support instead?

## TL;DR

**Short-term**: Use multiple vJoy devices (16 devices × 8 axes = 128 axes). Zero development needed.

**Medium-term**: Build a UMDF virtual HID driver using Microsoft's `vhidmini2` sample. Define 32+ axes and 256+ buttons per device. Sign via attestation with our EV cert.

**Long-term**: Consider open-sourcing VDroid as a standalone project so the entire accessibility and sim community benefits from a modern, extensible virtual controller driver.
