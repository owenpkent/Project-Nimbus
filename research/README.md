# Research & Technical Documentation

This folder contains research, design decisions, and roadmap documentation for Project Nimbus.

Project Nimbus is a virtual controller application that allows users to control games via mouse input (with potential future touchscreen support).

## For New Contributors

**Start here:**

1. **Understand the core problem**: Project Nimbus is a touchscreen virtual controller. When users touch the UI, the game loses focus and may pause or ignore input.

2. **What's solved**: Game Focus Mode automatically restores focus to the game after each interaction. See [completed/game-focus-mode.md](completed/game-focus-mode.md).

3. **What's not solved**: Games that capture/lock the mouse cursor prevent users from clicking Nimbus at all. This is the main accessibility barrier. See [in-progress/mouse-capture-problem.md](in-progress/mouse-capture-problem.md).

4. **Future direction**: For proper assistive technology behavior, Nimbus needs uiAccess privileges and code signing. See [roadmap/](roadmap/).

## Current Setup Context

```
┌─────────────────┐    Bluetooth    ┌─────────────────┐    Synergy    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Wheelchair    │ ─────────────── │     Laptop      │ ────────────► │   Gaming PC     │
│   Controller    │   (1 device     │  (mouse input)  │   (KVM over   │  (runs games)   │
│                 │    limit)       │                 │    network)   │                 │
└─────────────────┘                 └─────────────────┘               └─────────────────┘
```

- Wheelchair Bluetooth connects to laptop only (hardware limitation)
- Laptop runs Project Nimbus, controlled via mouse (touchscreen support planned)
- Gaming PC runs actual games
- Synergy bridges keyboard/mouse from laptop to gaming PC
